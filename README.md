# HowToCustomize
This is a step by step guide to customize your phone, most of the features only work on android.

## Choosing a **THEME**
You should choose a theme for your phone. Some possibilities are: *Playfull*, *Colorful*, *Abstract*, *Minimalistic*, or even making it look like some other Operating System. I always like to do a *Minimalistic* Setup with a *White Black Contrast*.

## Choosing a **ICON PACK** and a **WALLPAPER**
Choose an icon pack and a wallpaper matching your theme. __Before you can use an icon pack make sure that your phone or launcher supports custom icons, this can usually be set in *Settings > Homescreen > Icon Pack*!__ Now choose an icon pack. for example *Whicons* for a *Minimalistic* setup with a *White Black Contrast* or *Pixel Icon Pack* if you want to make it look like the *Google Pixel*. Now choose a wallpaper. You can also use desktop wallpapers, your phone is going to resize it automatically.

## Cleaning up the **HOMESCREEN**
First remove all the icons from your home screen and enable the app drawer. After you cleaned up all the icons and widgets you can now choose 4-10 apps to place on your home screen. I always add a clock widget and some information like weather or battery status.
